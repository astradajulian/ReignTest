# ReignTest

A test for Reign.

## Description

A simple API consuming app, fetches the latest page of an API. Allows the user to delete posts, open them, load the feed offline and some other minor things.

## Usage

The third party libraries where installed using CocoaPods. So the project should be opened through ReignTest.xcworkspace. The pods are loaded in the repository so it's not necesary to install them.
